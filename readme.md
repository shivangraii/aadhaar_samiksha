# Aadhaar Enrolment Trend & Insight Analyzer

## Problem Statement
Unlocking societal trends in Aadhaar enrolment and updates by identifying meaningful patterns, trends, and gaps from raw CSV data to support informed decision-making and system improvements.

## Overview
This project is an explainable data analytics system that processes Aadhaar enrolment, biometric, and demographic datasets to generate district-level trends and actionable insights. Using statistical aggregation and heatmap-based visualizations, the system converts raw data into clear indicators for administrative monitoring and governance use, without relying on black-box AI models.

## Objectives
- Analyze district-wise and time-wise Aadhaar enrolment trends  
- Identify regions with persistent enrolment gaps  
- Examine age-group based enrolment distribution  
- Enable transparent, explainable analytics for policy decisions  

## Key Features
- Supports preloaded and user-uploaded CSV datasets  
- Handles multiple CSV files simultaneously  
- Automatic data standardization and aggregation  
- Heatmap-based visualization of enrolment intensity and gaps  
- Text-based insights highlighting districts requiring attention  

## Tech Stack
- Python 3  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Streamlit 

## Methodology
1. Load multiple CSV datasets (saved or uploaded)
2. Standardize and validate data fields
3. Aggregate enrolment metrics at district and date levels
4. Analyze trends and deviations using statistical measures
5. Visualize patterns through heatmaps
6. Generate text-based insights for decision-makers

## Outputs
- District vs Time enrolment heatmaps  
- Age-group distribution heatmaps  
- Lists of consistently low-performing districts  
- Summary indicators for administrative review  

## Impact
- Enables continuous monitoring of Aadhaar enrolment performance  
- Supports data-driven administrative and policy decisions  
- Improves transparency and interpretability of system analysis
